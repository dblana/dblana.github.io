## About me

I am an engineer and data scientist, in the process of transitioning from academic research to using my skills to take action against the climate crisis. 

My research focus was dynamic modelling of complex systems. I initially worked on biomechanical models of the human arm, to help design prosthetic hands, and assistive technologies for people with paralysis. Since joining the [Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS) in 2019, I started applying my modelling methods to other healthcare problems. For example, I built an [epidemiological model](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/grampian_covid19_modelling) to help NHS Grampian with their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I now aim to use my modelling and data science skills, as well as my experience in community organising, to help the prevention and adaptation efforts on the climate emergency.
