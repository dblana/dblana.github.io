I am the Interim Director of the [Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/achds/index.php), and the Programme Lead for the [MSc Health Data Science](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/1230/health-data-science/).

I develop dynamic models of complex systems, to address clinical needs at a range of levels, from an individual patient to a healthcare organisation. I am passionate about improving research culture and [promoting open and reproducible research practices](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/guidebook). I am also an advocate for [diversity in health science and technology](https://www.onehealthtech.com/aberdeen).
