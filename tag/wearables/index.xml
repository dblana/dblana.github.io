      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aparito is a digital health company, that uses mobile phone applications and wearables to monitor patients outside the hospital setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study I worked on involves testing the technology on a cohort of 40 South African children with refractory epilepsy. There is little data on quality of life for South African children with epilepsy and their families, and limited resources for management of epilepsy. So there is a need to gather more data and develop strategies for personalised care.
This study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of wearable devices, and provide insight into the challenges of using this technology to monitor epilepsy in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave an update on this work at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biomedeng19.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioMedEng19 conference&lt;/a&gt; in London, 5-6 September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
