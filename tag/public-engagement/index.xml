&lt;a href=&#34;https://soapboxscience.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Soapbox Science&lt;/a&gt; involves female scientists standing on soapboxes in busy city streets, talking with passers-by about their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a brilliant outreach platform, for two reasons. First, instead of inviting people to a dedicated science event, it takes science to the streets, so it reaches people who might not consider attending a science event. And second, by focusing on female scientists, is raises the visibility of women in STEM, and hopefully encourages more girls to study science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the Stoke-on-Trent branch of Soapbox Science, and on Saturday July 6th 2019, we hosted our first ever Soapbox Science event in the centre of Stoke-on-Trent. It was a great opportunity to learn about scientific research done locally, straight from the scientists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was working at Keele University, I set up a makerspace for the local community called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keele.ac.uk/make/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Make Keele&lt;/a&gt;. Its aim was to get people of all ages and backgrounds tinkering with technology, and give them the opportunity to meet, learn from each other and get creative. Through this project I met the team behind 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wavemaker.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wavemaker&lt;/a&gt;, digital engagement specialists, who became good friends and collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Make Keele, I started a local branch of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://codeup.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Code Up&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation based in Manchester, which aims to provide free coding tuition to adults. While children learn coding at school, I wanted to give adults the same opportunity: to learn coding at no cost, in a friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;
