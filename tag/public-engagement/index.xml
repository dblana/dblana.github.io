&lt;a href=&#34;https://soapboxscience.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Soapbox Science&lt;/a&gt; involves female scientists standing on soapboxes in busy city streets, talking with passers-by about their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a brilliant outreach platform, for two reasons. First, instead of inviting people to a dedicated science event, it takes science to the streets, so it reaches people who might not consider attending a science event. And second, by focusing on female scientists, is raises the visibility of women in STEM, and hopefully encourages more girls to study science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the Stoke-on-Trent branch of Soapbox Science, and on Saturday July 6th 2019, we hosted our first ever Soapbox Science event in the centre of Stoke-on-Trent. It was a great opportunity to learn about scientific research done locally, straight from the scientists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
