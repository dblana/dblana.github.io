METHODS: Predictor selection and model development was conducted on a pre-existing dataset of 24 male participants from a single English football team's 2015/2016 season. RESULTS: The elastic net for zero-inflated Poisson penalty method was successful in shrinking the total number of predictors in the presence of high levels of multicollinearity. It was additionally identified that easily measurable data, that is, mass and body fat content, training type, duration and surface, fitness levels, normalised period of 'no-play' and time in competition could contribute to the probability of acquiring a time-loss injury. Furthermore, prolonged series of match-play and increased in-season injury reduced the probability of not sustaining an injury. CONCLUSION: For predictor selection, the elastic net for zero-inflated Poisson penalised method in combination with the use of ZIP regression modelling for predicting time-loss injuries have been identified appropriate methods for improving real-life applicability of injury prediction models. These methods are more appropriate for datasets subject to multicollinearity, smaller sample sizes and zero-inflation known to affect the performance of traditional statistical methods.

Control options for users, however, have not kept pace, meaning that the new devices are not used to their full potential. Promising developments in control technology reported in the literature have met with limited commercial and clinical success. We have previously described a biomechanical model of the hand that could be used for prosthesis control. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this approach in terms of kinematic fidelity of model-predicted finger movement and the computational performance of the model. We show the performance of the model in replicating recorded hand and finger kinematics and find average correlations of 0.89 between modelled and recorded motions; we show that the computational performance of the simulations is fast enough to achieve real-time control with a robotic hand in the loop; and we describe the use of the model for controlling object gripping. Despite some limitations in accessing sufficient driving signals, the model performance shows promise as a controller for prosthetic hands when driven with recorded EMG signals. User-in-the-loop testing with amputees is necessary in future work to evaluate the suitability of available driving signals, and to examine translation of offline results to online performance.","tags":null,"title":"Model-based control of individual finger movements for prosthetic hand function","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rSoapbox Science involves women scientists standing on soapboxes in busy city streets, talking with passers-by about their research.\nI think it is a brilliant outreach platform, for two reasons.

METHODS: This was a prospective observational longitudinal study of 24 male footballers from a single team in England, alongside analysis of an existing database over one season (September 2015-May 2016). A preseason FMS was carried out with scores recorded by an experienced assessor and derived, retrospectively, from the three-dimensional movement data that were simultaneously captured. The assessor scores were compared with the photogrammetric system to determine measurement validity, and predictive validity was quantified by assessing sensitivity and specificity (cut-off score of 14). RESULTS: The real-time assessor score matched the photogrammetric score awarded for one of the participants, was higher than the photogrammetric system for 22 participants and was lower than the photogrammetric system in 1 participant. There was no discernible relationship between FMS scores and the competencies required to be met as per the rules articulated for the allocation of a score. A higher number of total injuries were associated with higher FMS scores, whether determined through real-time assessment or codification of kinematic variables. Additionally, neither method of score determination was able to prospectively identify players at risk of serious injury. CONCLUSION: The FMS does not demonstrate the properties essential to be considered as a measurement scale and has neither measurement nor predictive validity. A possible reason for these observations could be the complexity in the instructions associated with the scale. Further work on eliminating redundancies and improving the measurement properties is recommended.","tags":null,"title":"Study of the measurement and predictive validity of the functional movement screen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diederik JD Ameln","Edward K Chadwick","Dimitra Blana","Alessio Murgia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"aaee5855f25a5d33418ad5e29201090c","permalink":"/publication/ameln-2018-stabilizing/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T14:51:04.652802Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ameln-2018-stabilizing/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether and how much the stabilizing role of the shoulder muscles changes as a function of humeral elevation and the plane of elevation.

RESULTS: The range of the stability ratios was [Formula: see text] for the rotator cuff muscles compared to [Formula: see text] for the superficial shoulder muscles. In the superior-inferior direction, the stability ratios of all muscles changed with humeral elevation and for infraspinatus, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi and deltoid also with the plane of elevation. In the anterior-posterior direction, the stability ratios of all muscles changed with humeral elevation, except for the deltoid, and with the plane of elevation, except for the supraspinatus, with interaction effects in all muscles. CONCLUSION: The rotator cuff muscles provide greater compression than shear forces during all tasks.

We evaluated this scheme with ten able-bodied subjects offline, as well as in a target-reaching task presented in an immersive virtual reality environment.

Robustness in the presence of weakened muscles was also tested. The two optimized gain sets were found to have very similar performance to each other on all metrics, and to exhibit significantly better accuracy, compared with the three standard gain sets. All gain sets investigated used physiologically acceptable amounts of muscular activation.

Real-time models of the arm previously described have not included the ability to model the independently controlled scapula and clavicle, limiting their utility for clinical applications of this nature. The goal of this study therefore was to evaluate the performance and mechanical behavior of a real-time, dynamic model of the arm and shoulder girdle. The model comprises seven segments linked by eleven degrees of freedom and actuated by 138 muscle elements. Polynomials were generated to describe the muscle lines of action to reduce computation time, and an implicit, first-order Rosenbrock formulation of the equations of motion was used to increase simulation step-size. The model simulated flexion of the arm faster than real time, simulation time being 92% of actual movement time on standard desktop hardware. Modeled maximum isometric torque values agreed well with values from the literature, showing that the model simulates the moment-generating behavior of a real human arm. The speed of the model enables experiments where the user controls the virtual arm and receives visual feedback in real time.

An electrode-selection method has been developed that uses a customized musculoskeletal model.

User interfaces for such systems typically derive commands from mechanically unrelated parts of the body with retained volitional control, and are unnatural and unable to simultaneously command the various joints of the arm. Neural interface systems, based on spiking intracortical signals recorded from the arm area of motor cortex, have shown the ability to control computer cursors, robotic arms and individual muscles in intact non-human primates. Such neural interface systems may thus offer a more natural source of commands for restoring dexterous movements via FES. However, the ability to use decoded neural signals to control the complex mechanical dynamics of a reanimated human limb, rather than the kinematics of a computer mouse, has not been demonstrated. This study demonstrates the ability of an individual with long-standing tetraplegia to use cortical neuron recordings to command the real-time movements of a simulated dynamic arm. This virtual arm replicates the dynamics associated with arm mass and muscle contractile properties, as well as those of an FES feedback controller that converts user commands into the required muscle activation patterns. An individual with long-standing tetraplegia was thus able to control a virtual, two-joint, dynamic arm in real time using commands derived from an existing human intracortical interface technology. These results show the feasibility of combining such an intracortical interface with existing FES systems to provide a high-performance, natural system for restoring arm and hand function in individuals with extensive paralysis.","tags":null,"title":"Continuous neuronal ensemble control of simulated arm reaching by a human with tetraplegia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonie J van den Bogert","Dimitra Blana","Dieter Heinrich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"70a4ae0aaf3291b8342579cc2f00724a","permalink":"/publication/van-2011-implicit/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T14:51:04.637174Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-2011-implicit/","section":"publication","summary":"The ordinary differential equations for musculoskeletal dynamics are often numerically stiff and highly nonlinear. Consequently, simulations require small time steps, and optimal control problems are slow to solve and have poor convergence. In this paper, we present an implicit formulation of musculoskeletal dynamics, which leads to new numerical methods for simulation and optimal control, with the expectation that we can mitigate some of these problems. A first order Rosenbrock method was developed for solving forward dynamic problems using the implicit formulation. It was used to perform real-time dynamic simulation of a complex shoulder arm system with extreme dynamic stiffness. Simulations had an RMS error of only 0.11 degrees in joint angles when running at real-time speed. For optimal control of musculoskeletal systems, a direct collocation method was developed for implicitly formulated models. The method was applied to predict gait with a prosthetic foot and ankle. Solutions were obtained in well under one hour of computation time and demonstrated how patients may adapt their gait to compensate for limitations of a specific prosthetic limb design. The optimal control method was also applied to a state estimation problem in sports biomechanics, where forces during skiing were estimated from noisy and incomplete kinematic data. Using a full musculoskeletal dynamics model for state estimation had the additional advantage that forward dynamic simulations, could be done with the same implicitly formulated model to simulate injuries and perturbation responses. While these methods are powerful and allow solution of previously intractable problems, there are still considerable numerical challenges, especially related to the convergence of gradient-based solvers.","tags":null,"title":"Implicit methods for efficient musculoskeletal simulation and optimal control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitra Blana","Robert F Kirsch","Edward K Chadwick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"fb32bb03b73c573acf0a10e785d26a07","permalink":"/publication/blana-2009-combined/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T14:51:04.630665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blana-2009-combined/","section":"publication","summary":"A functional electrical stimulation controller is presented that uses a combination of feedforward and feedback for arm control in high-level injury.

For the design and testing of these systems, a biomechanical model of the shoulder and elbow has been developed, to be used as a substitute for the human arm. It can be used to design and evaluate specific implementations of FES systems, as well as FES controllers. The model can be customized to simulate a variety of pathological conditions. For example, by adjusting the maximum force the muscles can produce, the model can be used to simulate an individual with tetraplegia and to explore the effects of FES of different muscle sets. The model comprises six bones, five joints, nine degrees of freedom, and 29 shoulder and arm muscles. It was developed using commercial, graphics-based modeling and simulation packages that are easily accessible to other researchers and can be readily interfaced to other analysis packages. It can be used for both forward-dynamic (inputs: muscle activation and external load; outputs: motions) and inverse-dynamic (inputs: motions and external load; outputs: muscle activation) simulations. Our model was verified by comparing the model calculated muscle activations to electromyographic signals recorded from shoulder and arm muscles of five subjects. As an example of its application to neuroprosthesis design, the model was used to demonstrate the importance of rotator cuff muscle stimulation when aiming to restore humeral elevation.

This paper presents a musculoskeletal model-based approach for optimizing the muscle set used for functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the shoulder and elbow in this population. Experimentally recorded kinematics from able-bodied subjects served as inputs to a musculoskeletal model of the shoulder and elbow, which was modified to reflect the reduced muscle force capacities of an individual with C5 SCI but also the potential of using FES to activate paralyzed muscles. A large number of inverse dynamic simulations mimicking typical activities of daily living were performed that included 1) muscles with retained voluntary control and 2) many different combinations of stimulated paralyzed muscles. These results indicate that a muscle set consisting of the serratus anterior, infraspinatus and triceps would enable the greatest range of relevant movements.

We focus on the values of the standard deviation of the wavelet components (up to scale index 5) and we apply a Self-Organizing-Map in order to investigate the relationship between the fetal heart rate variability in different scales and FSpO/sub 2/ (taking as a threshold for the FSpO/sub 2/, the 30% level and considering the minimum value of FSpO/sub 2/ during a 10-minute segment) for normal and acidemic fetuses during the second stage of labor, which can be used to discriminate acidemic fetuses from normal ones. A total accuracy of 91% has been achieved, enabling us to correctly classify all the normal cases (but one) as belonging in the normal group and all pathologic cases (but two) as belonging in the acidemia group, therefore providing a clinically significant measure for the discrimination of the different groups.
