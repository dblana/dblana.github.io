There is little data on quality of life for South African children with epilepsy and their families, and limited resources for management of epilepsy. So there is a need to gather more data and develop strategies for personalised care. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of wearable devices, and provide insight into the challenges of using this technology to monitor epilepsy in Africa.\nI gave an update on this work at the BioMedEng19 conference in London, 5-6 September 2019.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d2372d922fcfcc6682d4a06a2bba5359","permalink":"/project/aparito/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aparito/","section":"project","summary":"Remote Monitoring of Epilepsy in South African Children","tags":["Wearables"],"title":"Mobile Health Technology","type":"project"}]
