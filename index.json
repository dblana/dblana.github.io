But the damage to the neck means that muscles are not receiving electrical signals from the brain, and this is why they are not producing movement. If we could electrically stimulate the muscles, we could restore movement.\nIn this project, we use a combination of electrical stimulation to elicit forces in paralysed muscles, and mobile arm supports to compensate for insufficient muscle force where necessary.\nMy role is to develop computational models specific to an individual\u0026rsquo;s functional limitations, to produce patient-specific interventions.\nI am also leading the public engagement work, in collaboration with New Vic Borderlines, the outreach department of the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme.\nOur project follows the principles of Open Science.

It was a unique experience, that involved designing hands-on activities for people of all ages, and managing a large group of volunteers. The exhibition had more than 11000 visitors!

First, instead of inviting people to a dedicated science event, it takes science to the streets, so it reaches people who might not consider attending a science event. And second, by focusing on female scientists, is raises the visibility of women in STEM, and hopefully encourages more girls to study science and engineering.\nI set up the Stoke-on-Trent branch of Soapbox Science, and on Saturday July 6th 2019, we hosted our first ever Soapbox Science event in the centre of Stoke-on-Trent.

Using code can save time and reduce errors by automating routine tasks, and produce new insights by enabling complex calculations. However, not everyone has the skills or time to learn how to develop their own code. So the aim of this project is to bring everyone interested in movement analysis together, to share code and the expertise that exists in the community.\nBy taking part in the Mozilla Open Leaders program I learned a huge amount about working openly, and developing projects that are useful, inviting and inclusive.\n\rFind out more.\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"79df58d5cd04b665fabf857678a4cf38","permalink":"/project/cmas-open-code/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cmas-open-code/","section":"project","summary":"A free online platform for sharing code and resources among clinical movement analysis laboratories.","tags":["Biomechanics","Movement analysis","Coding","Open science"],"title":"CMAS Open Code","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Aparito is a digital health company, that uses mobile phone applications and wearables to monitor patients outside the hospital setting.\nThe study I worked on involves testing the technology on a cohort of 40 South African children with refractory epilepsy.

So there is a need to gather more data and develop strategies for personalised care.
